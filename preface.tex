\noindent
This paper is the report written as part of the specialization project course taken in the 9th semester (fall 2013) of my 5-year MSc in Communication Technology at the \gls{ntnu}, awarding 15 ECTS credits. It is focused around the experimental process of determining whether or not the Lua programming language is suited for developing state machine systems on embedded, memory-constrained devices.

\noindent
This process has given me more insight in various topics related to both programming language semantics and working with software on embedded devices, which to me is quite interesting. Hopefully, the report will be interesting and offer some new insights also to the reader.

\noindent
I would like to thank my supervisor, Frank Alexander Kraemer for useful advice during my work, especially in the early phases. I would also like to thank my good friend Sandor Zeestraten for taking the time to read through and comment on the report. \\
